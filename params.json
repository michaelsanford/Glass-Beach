{"name":"Glass Beach","tagline":"Glassware for Toronto Glass Hackathon V2: Beach Water Quality","body":"Glass-Beach\r\n===========\r\n\r\nGlassware for Toronto Glass Hackathon V2: Beach Water Quality\r\n\r\n## Intro\r\n\r\nResults from daily water samples taken at Toronto's beaches is made available as part of the City's [Open Data Initiative and Open311](http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=80bd0ea14b661310VgnVCM1000003dd60f89RCRD&vgnextchannel=8517e03bb8d1e310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD).\r\n Our team decided to take this information, correlate it with positonal data from GPS, and create\r\n a data-driven, location-based piece of Glassware that reports swimming conditions in a user-friendly way\r\n to a user standing at one of Toronto's 11 beaches.\r\n\r\n## Workflow\r\n\r\n### Invocation\r\n![Ok, Glass: how's the water?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelsanford/Glass-Beach/gh-pages/images/screenshots/how_water.png)\r\n\r\n### Geolocation\r\n\r\n![Geolocation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelsanford/Glass-Beach/gh-pages/images/screenshots/latlong.png)\r\n\r\n### Responses\r\n\r\n![Safe to swim](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelsanford/Glass-Beach/gh-pages/images/screenshots/safe.png)\r\n\r\n![Unsafe to swim](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelsanford/Glass-Beach/gh-pages/images/screenshots/unsafe.png)\r\n\r\n![Error handling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelsanford/Glass-Beach/gh-pages/images/screenshots/nobeach.png)\r\n\r\n## Mirror API (backend)\r\n\r\n### Design\r\n\r\nThe Mirror API was scaffolded from the [mirror-api-php](https://github.com/googleglass/mirror-quickstart-php) sample application (at 6ebe5a) and modified to suit our needs.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving a request from the Google API listener, containing either: \r\n\r\n1. the numeric id of a beach (from a menu); or \r\n2. geographic coordinates (from GPS)\r\n\r\nthe Glass-Beach Mirror API contacts Toronto's Open Data source for beach water quality and extracts its status {`Safe`/`Unsafe`} and any advisory messages.\r\n\r\n### Installing\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit-clone --recursive git@github.com:michaelsanford/Glass-Beach.git \\\r\n && cd  Glass-Beach/mirror-api-php  \\\r\n && vagrant up\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, log in to the [Google API Console](https://code.google.com/apis/console/) create an OAuth 2 key and ensure that you have checked off \"Mirror API\" in the Services tab. Add appropriate values to `config.php`.\r\n\r\n## Glassware (frontend)\r\n\r\n### Invocation\r\n`\"Ok, Glass: How's the water?\"`\r\n\r\n### Building\r\nImport the project from `Glass-Beach/Glassware` into Android Studio, making sure you've installed *Android 4.2.2 (API 19)* and the *Glass Development Kit Preview* from the SDK Manager.\r\n\r\nCross your fingers.\r\n\r\nBuild.\r\n\r\n### Design\r\nThe application was scaffolded from the [gdk-apidemo-sample](https://github.com/googleglass/gdk-apidemo-sample) (at db3cc0) and modified by [Steven]() and [Skyler]().\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nFeel free to fork (and send pull requests)!
